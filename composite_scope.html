  <h1>Heuristic: Composite Block</h1>
</div>
<div class="notice">
  <p>Always remember that a heuristic should not be applied like a rule. It's something that when applied may give you insight; but is never gauranteed to.</p>

  <div class="description">
    <p>A composite block is a block of code that contains both assignments (a = 5) and methods (calculate_total()). This can hint towards multiple things going on within the block.</p>
    <p>Let's look at an example. Our before code gets a set of data, then iterates over it, then gets more data, then iterates over the new data before doing the actual desired effect.</p>
  </div>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/3999487.js?file=before.rb"></script>

<div class="first pass">
  <h2>First Pass</h2>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Our first step is to pull the assignments into their own blocks.</p>
    <p>This gives us two blocks that are getting data and then one that acts upon that data. However if we look closely at the remove_duplicates block we are getting some data; iterating over it; getting some more before acting upon. We can make another pass here to clear this up.
    <p>In terms of testability it's now much easier to test because you can stub the 'duplicate_sets' call to return what you wanted rather than stubbing a part of ActiveRecord.

<div class="second pass">
  <h2>Second Pass</h2>
  <div class="description">
    <p>We change the remove_duplicates (our original) block to take it's data rather than get it's own; this means it's now only doing one thing and is even easier to test as know longer need to stub.</p>
    <p>The delete_all_but_one_record_from_set is a little different still; it gets data; iterates and acts. We could go another iteration to split this up again; however I'll stop here. How far you go is up to the context of your code base.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of the delete_all_but_one_record_from_set is that it is well named and removes the need to have the comment.</p>

      <li>duplicate_sets - gets data</li>
      <li>identical_translations_matching_record - gets data</li>
      <li>delete_all_but_one_record_from_set - gets data; does something to it (this still does 2 things)</li>
